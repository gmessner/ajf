AJF - A Java Framework

AJF is an easy to consume framework that will greatly accelerate the building of Swing and console based Java applications.

AJF began life in the early 2000's as the framework used to help build Breeze XML Studio, an XML/Java developer application created by The Breeze Factor. AJF has since been released to the public domain with an MIT license. As Java has advanced, AJF has been updated to make use of new Java features and is compatiable with Java 6 and newer versions of Java.
